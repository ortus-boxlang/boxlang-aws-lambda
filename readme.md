## Welcome to the BoxLang AWS Lambda Runtime

This repository contains the AWS Lambda Runtime for the BoxLang language. This runtime allows you to run BoxLang code in AWS Lambda functions. The runtime is built using the AWS Lambda Custom Runtime API and the BoxLang interpreter.

## Usage

To use it, you need to create a Lambda function and specify `Java 21` as the runtime. The class that executes your BoxLang code is `ortus.boxlang.runtime.aws.LambdaRunner`. By convention it will execute a `Lambda.bx` file in the root (`/var/task/Lambda.bx`) of the Lambda function, via the `run()` method. The method signature can look like this:

```java
// Lambda.bx
class{

	function run( event, context, response ){
		// Your code here
	}

}
```

- The `event` parameter is the event data that is passed to the Lambda function as a `Struct`.
- The `context` parameter is the context object that is passed to the Lambda function. This matches the AWS Lambda context object: `com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context`.
- The `response` parameter is the response object that is passed to the Lambda function.

### Response Struct

The `response` object is a `Struct` that you can use to set the response data. The `response` object has the following keys:

- `statusCode` : The HTTP status code for the response.
- `headers` : A `Struct` of headers to send in the response.
- `body` : The body of the response, which can be anything.

The BoxLang lambda runner will return the `response` object as the response to the Lambda function as a JSON object.

### Testing the Lambda Locally

#### Build

```
gradle shadowJar
gradle buildMainZip
```

#### AWS Sam CLI

##### Installing AWS Sam CLI

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html

#### Invoking your Lambda Locally with Sample Event Data

```
sam local invoke bxFunction --event=workbench/sampleEvents/api.json
sam local invoke bxFunction --event=workbench/sampleEvents/event.json
```

#### Invoking your Lambda Locally with Debug Mode

```
sam local invoke bxFunction --event=workbench/sampleEvents/api.json --debug
sam local invoke bxFunction --event=workbench/sampleEvents/event.json --debug
```

### Custom Lambda Function

If you don't want to use the convention of `Lambda.bx` then you can setup an environment variable called `BOXLANG_LAMBDA_CLASS` with the full path to the BoxLang class that will execute your code. The class must have a `run()` method that matches the signature above.

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode by setting the environment variable `BOXLANG_LAMBDA_DEBUG` to `true`. This will output debug information to the Lambda logs.

### Example

Here is an example of a simple Lambda function that returns a `Hello World` response:

```java
// Lambda.bx
class{

	function run( event, context, response ){
		// response.statusCode = 200; set by default
		response.headers = {
			"Content-Type" : "text/plain"
		};
		response.body = "Hello World";
	}

}
```

However, if you don't even want to deal with the `response` struct, you can just use a return and whatever you return will be placed for you in the `response.body`.

```java
// Lambda.bx
class{

	function run( event, context ){
		return "Hello World";
	}

}
```

## Packaging

In order to deploy your function to AWS Lambda, you need to package the runtime and your BoxLang code into a zip file. The zip file should contain the following structure:

```
+ Lambda.bx
/lib
  + boxlang-aws-lambda-1.0.0-all.jar
```

You can use our source template here: https://github.com/ortus-solutions-private/boxlang-aws-lambda-template
to give you a head start in building your serverless applications.
